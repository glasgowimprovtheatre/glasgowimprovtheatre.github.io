            The Glasgow Improv Theatre (“The GIT”) is the home of improv comedy in Scotland and one of the largest improv theatres in the UK. Founded in 2016 by Martin James—an alum of the Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) in Los Angeles—The GIT began with small shows in Glasgow pubs and quickly evolved into the cornerstone of Scotland's improv scene. Today, the theatre is run by Martin James and John McInnes, and it offers a full curriculum of improv training, from beginner drop-ins and Improv 101 to advanced, performance-focused classes.

            The GIT runs a packed weekly programme at The Old Hairdressers, including Harold Night and Perfect Improv—the latter featuring acclaimed guests such as Josie Long, Zara Gladman, Christopher Macarthur-Boyd, and Marc Jennings. Each year, The GIT also holds open auditions for its House Teams, offering emerging performers free coaching, regular stage time, and a vibrant creative community. The theatre is committed to removing barriers to entry through its scholarship program, providing free training opportunities to support new and diverse talent.
