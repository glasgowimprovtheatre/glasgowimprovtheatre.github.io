      Martin James founded the Glasgow Improv Theatre and studied improv at the Upright Citizen Brigade Theatre in Los Angeles. He hosts and performs in Campfire Improv, a monthly show at Monkey Barrel Comedy in Edinburgh. At the Glasgow Improv Theatre, he wears many hats—teaching classes, hosting shows, performing regularly, and handling tech and behind-the-scenes admin. He has performed at festivals across the UK and internationally, including the Edinburgh Fringe, Glasgow Comedy Festival, Del Close Marathon in New York, and festivals in Los Angeles, Reykjavík, London, Bristol, Leeds, and Newcastle. Martin launched Glasgow Harold Night in 2016, which has run every month since, pausing only for global pandemics.

          One of the all-time great improv groups - hugely influential in the sea, and the standard-bearers for how good, funny and artful long-form improv could be. At their best, they could play manic silliness and slow, patient moments in the same show. They're all dead humans who are now human-looking ghost fish.
