          They are going to do a Harold and need a suggestion to get started. Or they are going to do their Improv Spotify show, please add songs to their playlist.

          The test to determine who Yer Da is came back inconclusive, but this bunch of improvisers will perform for your acceptance anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
          You'll find them performing monthly at Glasgow Improv Theatre in their show Yer Da Wants a Word where they do a set (probably a Haroldy montage, it makes sense honest) before hosting arguably the funnest improv jam around.
      </p>
      <p>
          Team members have been spotted doing guest appearances on legendary podcast Improv4Humans, Will Hines' How Was Your Week and in late night Edinburgh improv show Dating Crapp.

      <p>
          One of the all-time great improv groups - hugely influential in the sea, and the standard-bearers for how good, funny and artful long-form improv could be. At their best, they could play manic silliness and slow, patient moments in the same show. They're all dead humans who are now human-looking ghost fish.
